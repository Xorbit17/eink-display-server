# Style: Manga-Dynamic

## Core Look
- **Linework:** Crisp black ink lines with varied thickness—thicker for outlines and speed lines, thinner for details.  
- **Palette:** Primarily black and white with screentone shading; optional limited pops of color (e.g., speed effects or sound effects).  
- **Figure treatment:** Exaggerated anatomy in motion; foreshortening; energetic poses; expressive faces with large, dramatic eyes.  
- **Composition:** Angled panels, tilted frames, and overlapping figures to emphasize intensity in group shots.  
- **Lighting & Shading:** Strong contrast; screentones, crosshatching, and solid blacks to define form and depth.  

## Action Emphasis
- Add **speed lines, burst effects, and impact frames** to convey fast-paced movement.  
- Use **motion exaggeration**: stretched limbs, flowing hair, clothes trailing behind.  
- For groups, emphasize **interaction and chaos**—overlapping figures, dynamic diagonals.  

## Background Options
- Abstract motion effects: speed streaks, radial bursts, shattered lines.  
- Minimal or stylized backgrounds to focus attention on characters’ motion.  
- If environmental context is needed: simplified cityscapes, interiors, or battlefield settings drawn with manga-style linework.  

## Iconography (optional)
- Onomatopoeia in bold manga lettering: “ドン!” (DON!), “ズバン!” (ZUBAN!), “WHAM!”  
- Motion bursts around hands, feet, or weapons.  

## Do
- Push anatomy and perspective for dramatic effect.  
- Keep figures clean and bold against the page.  
- Use group composition like a splash page: chaotic but readable.  

## Avoid
- Photorealistic detail or gradients.  
- Blurry motion blur (use drawn speed effects instead).  
- Static, stiff poses.
