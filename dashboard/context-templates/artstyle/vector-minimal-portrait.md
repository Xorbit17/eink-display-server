# Art Style: Minimal Vector Portrait

- **Core Look**
  - Flat, clean shapes with no shading or gradients.
  - Use bold, uniform areas of color—solid fills without texture.
  - Crisp, geometric outlines or edge cuts to define facial and body features.

- **Figure Treatment**
  - Simplify anatomy: reduce detail to key forms and recognizable features.
  - Use strong silhouette emphasis and minimal interior lines.
  - Portraits should feel iconic, almost like a logo or avatar.

- **Color & Palette**
  - Limit palette to 3–6 bold colors.
  - Prefer high-contrast combinations (light/dark, complementary hues).
  - Optional: monochrome with accent color.

- **Composition**
  - Subject centered or slightly offset.
  - Background should be a single flat field or simple geometric block of color.
  - Avoid clutter or unnecessary detail.

- **Do**
  - Lean into SVG-like digital clarity—sharp edges, pure shapes.
  - Use clear contrast between subject and background.
  - Maintain a poster-like, scalable look.

- **Avoid**
  - Gradients, shading, textures, or painterly effects.
  - Excessive linework or tiny details smaller than a few pixels.
  - Soft edges or blurry transitions.
