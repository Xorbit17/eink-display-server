# Style: Ink-Watercolor

## Core Look
- **Linework:** Delicate black or dark ink outlines define the subject, varying from fine to slightly expressive strokes.  
- **Coloring:** Soft watercolor washes fill in forms—translucent, layered tones that allow the ink to remain dominant.  
- **Texture:** Slight unevenness and pooling of pigment to mimic watercolor paper effect.  

## Shading & Depth
- Build depth with overlapping light washes rather than heavy shading.  
- Use subtle color bleeding at edges for a natural watercolor look.  

## Background Treatment
- Keep background minimal—either light washes of color or faint, suggestive brush textures.  
- Negative space can be preserved as white paper to emphasize the figure.  

## Overall Composition
- Balance crisp ink definition with loose, airy watercolor fills.  
- Imperfections (like visible brush edges or slight color bleed) are part of the charm.  

## Do
- Let the ink hold the structure.  
- Keep watercolor transparent and luminous.  
- Suggest texture and detail with varied brush pressure.  

## Avoid
- Heavy gradients or digital smoothness.  
- Overly sharp or perfectly uniform color fields.  
- Excessive micro-detail or photorealism.
