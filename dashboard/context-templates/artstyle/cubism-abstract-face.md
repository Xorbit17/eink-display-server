# Style: Cubism Abstract Face

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Bold, contrasting colors; often primary (red, blue, yellow) mixed with neutrals (black, white, gray).
- **Finish:** Flat planes of color with sharp separations; painterly or blocky textures acceptable.
- **Form:** Fractured, overlapping geometric shapes that together suggest a face.
- **Perspective:** Multiple angles simultaneously—eyes, nose, and mouth can appear rotated or seen from different viewpoints at once.
- **Linework:** Angular, decisive lines to carve out forms; outlines may be heavy or absent depending on the area.

## Composition
- Break the face into asymmetrical facets (triangles, rectangles, trapezoids).
- Use overlapping fragments to distort conventional symmetry.
- Allow background to merge with facial geometry in places, flattening depth.

## Shading & Depth
- Minimal shading; instead, rely on planes of color to create form.
- Use tonal contrast (light vs. dark shapes) rather than gradients.

## Do
- Suggest recognizable facial features but keep them fractured.
- Emphasize geometric abstraction over realism.
- Include overlapping planes and interlocking shapes.
- Keep edges sharp and decisive.

## Avoid
- Soft transitions, gradients, or painterly blending.
- Photographic likeness or smooth realism.
- Excess clutter—focus on bold geometric abstraction.
