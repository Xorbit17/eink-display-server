# Style: Gritty Western Comics

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Dusty browns, muted reds, ochres, and desaturated blues. Occasional stark black shadows and dirty whites for contrast.
- **Finish:** Rough, textured inking with visible brush or pen strokes; worn, almost weathered paper feel.
- **Figure treatment:** Rugged, weather-beaten faces; strong jawlines; lined skin; gritty realism with a hint of exaggeration.
- **Composition:** Cinematic panelsâ€”close-ups of eyes, wide shots of desolate towns, tense stand-offs. Strong horizon lines, sparse landscapes.
- **Lighting:** Harsh sunlight and deep shadows; high-contrast chiaroscuro to suggest heat and tension.
- **Background options:** Desert plains, tumbleweeds, saloons, cracked wooden fences, barren mesas, train tracks fading into the horizon.

## Iconography (optional)
- Revolvers, cowboy hats, spurs, whisky bottles, wanted posters, playing cards, sheriff badges.
- Dust clouds, bar doors, lantern light, silhouetted riders.

## Typography (optional)
- Bold block lettering with distressed textures; cracked serif type resembling old Western posters.

## Do
- Emphasize grit, texture, and shadow.
- Keep the linework bold and jagged where possible.
- Push the feeling of dryness, dust, and heat.

## Avoid
- Smooth gradients or polished modern comic finish.
- Overly saturated neon palettes.
- Soft, whimsical, or playful character treatment.
