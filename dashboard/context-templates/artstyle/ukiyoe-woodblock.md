# Style: Ukiyo-e Woodblock

Traditional Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock print style, inspired by Edo-period masters.

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Muted, natural pigments—indigo blues, earthy browns, faded reds, pale greens, and off-white. Slightly desaturated with soft tonal variation.
- **Finish:** Flat areas of solid color with visible woodblock texture and subtle grain. Slight misregistration of colors is acceptable as part of the aesthetic.
- **Linework:** Bold, flowing black contour lines with graceful tapering; minimal shading inside forms. Lines define both figure and background elements.
- **Figure Treatment:** Stylized anatomy with elongated forms, elegant gestures, and calm expressions. Faces simplified—minimal detail for eyes, nose, mouth.
- **Composition:** Flattened perspective; diagonal arrangements; strong vertical or horizontal elements. Cropping can be dramatic (e.g., figures partly cut by frame).
- **Lighting:** Flat with little to no shadows. Depth conveyed through overlapping planes and patterns rather than shading.

## Background & Setting
- Simplified natural elements: waves, mountains, clouds, trees, or cherry blossoms.
- Architectural forms: shoji screens, tatami interiors, bridges, teahouses.
- Landscapes often with sweeping horizon lines, stylized skies, or weather effects (rain lines, snow dots, wind-swept grasses).

## Texture & Pattern
- Decorative kimono and fabric patterns (floral motifs, waves, checks).
- Woodgrain visible in large flat areas of color.
- Repeated shapes and patterned textures for balance and rhythm.

## Iconography (optional)
- Traditional motifs: cranes, koi, Mt. Fuji, boats, cherry blossoms, geisha, kabuki actors, samurai, courtesans.
- Seasonal symbols: plum blossoms (spring), maple leaves (autumn), snow (winter).

## Do
- Use flat, poster-like color fields bounded by strong outlines.
- Emphasize decorative patterns in clothing and backgrounds.
- Keep compositions elegant, balanced, and slightly formal.
- Incorporate stylized calligraphic text blocks or cartouches when space allows.

## Avoid
- Realistic shading or gradients.
- Photographic depth-of-field or perspective rendering.
- Modern neon or highly saturated colors.
- Overly detailed or micro-textural rendering.
