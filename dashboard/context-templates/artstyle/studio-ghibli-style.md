# Style: Studio Ghibli

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Natural, balanced colors with warm highlights; greens, blues, and earth tones dominate; selective accents for focus.  
- **Finish:** Painterly yet crisp—cleanly defined shapes with visible hand-painted texture.  
- **Figure treatment:** Expressive, rounded faces with clear emotions; eyes reflective and slightly larger than realistic; anatomy simplified but natural.  
- **Composition:** Cinematic framing—clear staging, subject integrated into environment.  
- **Lighting:** Bright, dramatic lighting reminiscent of film stills (golden skies, daylight clarity, warm lamplight).  

## Background Treatment
- Painterly backgrounds that feel like animation backdrops.  
- Lush nature (forests, fields, skies, seaside) or cozy interiors with clear structure and painterly texture.  
- Avoid excessive gradients—prefer stepped shading with painterly brushwork.  

## Mood & Atmosphere
- Capture emotional clarity: wonder, warmth, or quiet melancholy.  
- Scene should feel like a captured moment from an animation, grounded and cinematic.  

## Do
- Use painterly brushwork throughout, consistent with animation background art.  
- Keep forms crisp and well-defined for clarity on e-ink.  
- Harmonize subject and background compositionally.  

## Avoid
- Blurry edges or heavy antialiasing.  
- Hyper-realism or photographic texture.  
- Excessively flat coloring without painterly depth.
