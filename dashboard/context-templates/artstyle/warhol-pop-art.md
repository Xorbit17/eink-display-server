# Style: Warhol Pop Art

This art style is based on Andy Warhol’s iconic Pop Art works from the 1960s. It emphasizes repetition, flat bold colors, and graphic simplicity.

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Highly saturated primaries and secondaries (cyan, magenta, yellow, red, green, electric blue); flat application with no gradients.
- **Finish:** Silkscreen-like effect; bold color fills; flat, simplified shapes; clear separation between subject and background.
- **Figure treatment:** Simplify facial features and forms into block-like areas; strong contour lines or minimal outlines.
- **Composition:** Repeated panels (2×2, 3×3, or mirrored duplicates); each panel may use different contrasting color schemes.
- **Lighting:** Flattened—shadows minimized or replaced with color blocks.
- **Background options:** Flat monochrome fills or sharply contrasting color fields.

## Iconography (optional)
- Repetition of the same subject in different color schemes.
- Use of celebrity-portrait aesthetics—glamorous, iconic treatment.
- Decorative or symbolic overlays (dollar signs, product-like branding, stars, lips).

## Typography (optional)
- Bold sans-serif, commercial-feeling type.
- Place as a caption or brand-like label.

## Do
- Push color contrast to the extreme—unexpected pairings (yellow skin, blue hair, pink background).
- Embrace imperfections—slight misregistration of lines or color blocks.
- Create strong graphic punch with minimal detail.

## Avoid
- Photographic realism or smooth shading.
- Muted or naturalistic color palettes.
- Overly fine lines or painterly textures.
