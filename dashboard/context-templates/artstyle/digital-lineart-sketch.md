# Style: Digital Lineart Sketch

White background and black lines

## Core Look
- **Linework:** Clean, precise strokes resembling digital stylus work on a tablet; confident outlines with variable pressure tapering.
- **Shading:** Minimal—only light hatching or a few soft strokes for depth; keep the sketch airy and uncluttered.
- **Finish:** Retain the sense of a “work-in-progress” digital sketch; slightly imperfect but intentional.

## Composition
- Focus on the subject with uncluttered space around it.
- Use line weight to guide attention (thicker outlines for main forms, finer lines for details).
- Backgrounds should remain mostly blank or only hinted at with a few sketch lines.

## Texture & Depth
- Suggest digital medium (Photoshop, Procreate, Clip Studio) by keeping lines crisp, without paper grain.
- Avoid excessive blending—maintain sharp contrasts between line and empty space.
- A few stylized strokes may indicate shadows or form, but no heavy rendering.

## Optional
- Light digital tinting or subtle single-color wash, used sparingly, to emphasize shape or expression.
- Handwritten annotation or margin scribbles for an authentic sketchbook feel.
