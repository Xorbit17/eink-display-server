# Style: Ink Wash Painting

This style is inspired by traditional East Asian ink wash painting (Sumi-e, Chinese shuǐmòhuà).  
It emphasizes expressive brushstrokes, tonal variation, and a balance of empty and painted space.

Choose a main color for the ink: black, red, blue, green

## Core Look
- **Brushwork:** Loose, flowing strokes; visible brush texture; variable ink density from wet to dry.  
- **Tones:** Grayscale or muted monochrome with subtle tonal washes; emphasis on contrast between light washes and deep black strokes.  
- **Edges:** Soft feathered edges where ink bleeds into paper; occasional sharp calligraphic lines.  
- **Composition:** Minimalist; large open areas balanced with focal ink forms; asymmetry preferred.  
- **Lighting:** Implied through ink density rather than realistic shadows.

## Background & Setting
- **Space:** Use negative space as an essential design element—blank areas are intentional and powerful.  
- **Landscapes:** Mountains, rivers, trees suggested with sparse brushstrokes; avoid over-detailing.  
- **Figures/Animals:** Simplified, fluid forms; expressive rather than anatomically strict.  
- **Textures:** Paper grain suggested; ink bleed patterns.

## Do
- Suggest depth with layered ink washes rather than shading.  
- Emphasize rhythm and flow of brushstrokes.  
- Keep details minimal—focus on mood and impression.  

## Avoid
- Heavy gradients, photorealism, or polished smoothness.  
- Excessive linework or cluttered composition.  
- Bright saturated colors—stick to monochrome or muted tones.
