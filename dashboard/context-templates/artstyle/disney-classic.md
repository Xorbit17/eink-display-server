# Art Style: Disney-Classic

A hand-drawn animation look inspired by the golden age of Disney (used here purely as an art style reference).

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Soft, harmonious pastels with occasional bold accents.
- **Finish:** Smooth cel-shading with crisp outlines; visible hand-drawn charm; slight texture of traditional ink/paint.
- **Figure treatment:** Graceful, expressive characters with elegant anatomy and clear silhouettes.
- **Composition:** Balanced layouts; decorative framing; focus on central figures.
- **Lighting:** Even, flat animated lighting; simple tonal shadows; subtle highlights.
- **Background options:** Painterly watercolor or gouache-inspired backdrops; romanticized landscapes or interiors.

## Do
- Preserve timeless, storybook appeal.
- Keep outlines clean but organic, as if hand-inked.
- Add slight texture suggesting cel animation layers.

## Avoid
- Photographic realism.
- Digital gradients or hyper-rendering.
- References to specific Disney characters or films.
