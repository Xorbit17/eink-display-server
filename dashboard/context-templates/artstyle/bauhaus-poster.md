# Style: Bauhaus Poster

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Bold primaries (red, blue, yellow) balanced with black, white, and neutral grays.
- **Shapes:** Flat geometric forms—circles, triangles, squares, lines, and grids.
- **Finish:** Crisp, posterized blocks of color; sharp edges; no gradients.
- **Composition:** Asymmetrical yet balanced layouts; strong diagonal or vertical alignments.
- **Texture:** Clean and minimal—avoid painterly marks or visible brushstrokes.

## Typography (optional)
- Bold sans-serif type (inspired by Bauhaus typography).
- Letters may be arranged in vertical, diagonal, or circular orientations.
- Use text sparingly—short words or abstract letters.

## Iconography (optional)
- Abstract architectural silhouettes.
- Machine-age symbols: gears, levers, bridges, ladders, industrial motifs.
- Simple human or animal figures reduced to geometric shapes.

## Do
- Emphasize clarity and simplicity.
- Use geometric reduction for figures and objects.
- Ensure strong contrasts between colors and shapes.
- Keep the design playful but precise.

## Avoid
- Gradients, painterly textures, or organic ornamentation.
- Overly detailed rendering or naturalistic shading.
