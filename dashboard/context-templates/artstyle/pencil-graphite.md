# Style: Pencil & Graphite Drawing

Background is white (paper). Resulting image is grayscale because pencils or graphite is grey.

## Core Look
- **Medium:** Traditional pencil or graphite drawing—use visible strokes and textured shading.
- **Linework:** Confident but sketch-like outlines; vary line weight to emphasize contours and depth.
- **Shading:** Build tones gradually with hatching, cross-hatching, and smooth blending. Keep shading grain visible—do not blur.
- **Value Range:** Rich darks to light grays; mostly monochrome with subtle highlights from paper showing through.
- **Texture:** Preserve the feel of graphite on paper—grain, smudges, and tonal variation.

## Composition
- Subjects should resemble careful sketches, with attention to anatomy and proportion.
- Backgrounds can be minimal—lightly suggested forms or shaded gradients done with pencil strokes.
- Allow some “unfinished” edges where lines trail off, giving an authentic sketchbook quality.

## Do
- Show pencil grain and texture clearly.
- Use layered strokes to create shadows and volume.
- Keep edges defined but not overly crisp—let them soften naturally with pencil shading.

## Avoid
- Digital smooth gradients or airbrush effects.
- Overly darkened or photographic realism.
- Blurriness or noise that does not resemble graphite strokes.
