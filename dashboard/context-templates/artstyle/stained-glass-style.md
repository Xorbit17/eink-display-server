# Style: Stained-Glass Style

## Core Look
- **Linework:** Bold, dark outlines imitating lead came; clear separation between shapes; slightly irregular hand-crafted feel.
- **Coloring:** Flat, luminous jewel tones—deep cobalt blue, ruby red, emerald green, golden yellow, royal purple; no gradients.
- **Figures:** Simplified, stylized anatomy or motifs; frontal or iconic poses; minimal facial detail.
- **Composition:** Symmetrical or radial arrangements; framed in panels, arches, or circular rose-window forms.
- **Lighting:** High contrast between dark outlines and glowing color blocks; evoke light shining through glass.

## Background & Setting
- **Architecture:** Gothic arches, rose windows, pointed tracery shapes.
- **Landscapes:** Stylized, flat natural forms like trees, hills, or sunbursts.
- **Textures:** Flat, enamel-like surfaces within dark borders; no shading or blending.
- **Perspective:** Flat and iconic—emphasize symbolic presence rather than depth.

## Optional Iconography
- Floral motifs, vines, or geometric patterns filling gaps.
- Religious or mythological figures posed in medallion panels.
- Heraldic animals, angels, saints, or symbolic suns and stars.

## Do
- Use bold black leading lines to define every color block.
- Favor symmetry and repeating ornamental motifs.
- Keep figures and elements stylized, simplified, and iconic.

## Avoid
- Gradients, soft shading, or painterly blending.
- Excessive fine detail that would blur at small scale.
- Modern photo-realism or naturalistic perspective.
