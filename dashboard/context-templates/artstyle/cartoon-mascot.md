# Style: Cartoon Mascot

## Core Look
- **Linework:** Bold, clean outlines with strong contour emphasis; simplified shapes and rounded forms.  
- **Palette:** Bright, saturated colors with minimal shading; playful and eye-catching.  
- **Finish:** Flat fills with high contrast; crisp edges—no gradients.  

## Figure Treatment
- Exaggerated proportions (large heads, expressive eyes, oversized hands/feet).  
- Friendly, approachable expressions—smiles, winks, thumbs-up, or action poses.  
- Clear, simplified anatomy—avoid realistic detail.  

## Composition
- Subject isolated and central, like a character logo or brand mascot.  
- Minimal background: simple shapes, bursts, or flat color fields that highlight the mascot.  

## Optional Iconography
- Speech bubbles with short catchphrases (e.g., “Wow!”, “Let’s go!”, “Cool!”).  
- Props that enhance personality (sports gear, food item, microphone, etc.).  

## Do
- Keep the design playful and approachable.  
- Ensure bold readability at a glance.  
- Use consistent cartoon exaggeration across all features.  

## Avoid
- Realistic textures, heavy shading, or photographic details.  
- Overly complex backgrounds.  
- Muted or dull color palettes.
