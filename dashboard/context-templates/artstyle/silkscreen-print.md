# Style: Silkscreen Print

This art style is inspired by the bold layered look of silkscreen printing.  
Focus on high-contrast shapes, simplified color fields, and crisp layering.

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Limited, flat inks (3–5 strong colors). Favor saturated primaries and bold contrasts.  
- **Finish:** Hard-edged shapes, sharp separations; no gradients. Slight misregistration or offset layering is welcome.  
- **Figure treatment:** Simplify forms into blocky shapes and silhouettes. Facial details reduced to key features.  
- **Composition:** Bold, poster-like layouts. Overlapping layers of color to suggest depth.  
- **Lighting:** Minimal shading—rely on flat blocks of dark vs light color.  
- **Background options:** Simple abstract shapes, bold textural layers, or poster-like empty space.

## Surface & Texture
- Simulate ink-on-paper textures: slight halftone dots, overprinted areas, subtle uneven ink coverage.
- Visible overlapping ink layers where colors meet.

## Typography (optional)
- Large, blocky sans-serif lettering.
- Can appear integrated into the composition like a poster.

## Do
- Keep edges sharp, colors flat.
- Use offset layers or overprint effects to mimic silkscreen process.
- Favor bold, iconic shapes over fine details.

## Avoid
- Smooth gradients or soft airbrushed shading.
- Excessive fine detail under ~5px.
- Blurry or antialiased lines.
