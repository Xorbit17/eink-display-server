# Style: Retro Zoo Poster

This style is based on vintage mid-20th century animal or zoo advertising posters.

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Limited colors, often muted or slightly faded; earthy greens, ochres, oranges, browns; occasional bold accent tones.
- **Finish:** Flat, posterized blocks of color; crisp edges; slight paper grain or aged texture.
- **Figure treatment:** Simplified, stylized animals with bold silhouettes and minimal details; playful but dignified poses.
- **Composition:** Central animal or group framed by geometric shapes, banners, or decorative framing.
- **Lighting:** Minimal shading—use flat fills with rare two-tone shadowing for form.

## Background & Layout
- Large, uncluttered background areas with decorative geometric patterns, radiating lines, or stylized natural motifs (trees, sunbursts).
- Optional borders or framing devices, like circles, arches, or blocks.
- Include space for poster-like text placement (banner or bottom strip).

## Typography (optional)
- Bold sans-serif or Art Deco inspired fonts.
- Text such as “Visit the Zoo,” “See the Animals,” or “Wildlife Wonders.”

## Do
- Emphasize strong shapes and silhouettes.
- Keep gradients minimal—prefer solid fills.
- Add slight texture to simulate screen-printing or lithograph.

## Avoid
- Photorealism, micro-detail, heavy gradients, or blur.
- Overcrowding the layout with too many animals or background elements.
