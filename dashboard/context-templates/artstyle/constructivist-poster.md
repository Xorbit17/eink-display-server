Graphic Soviet-style constructivist poster art.  

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Strong reds, deep blacks, and stark whites with occasional beige or muted yellow; very limited palette.  
- **Finish:** Bold geometric blocks; crisp edges; flat tones; posterized reduction of detail.  
- **Composition:** Dynamic diagonals, asymmetry, overlapping shapes, and strong visual hierarchy.  
- **Figure treatment:** Stylized, minimal detail; sharp angles; abstracted or heroic poses.  

## Background & Geometry
- Geometric rays, circles, rectangles, and diagonals driving the eye.  
- Layered contrasts between figure and background (e.g., white figure against black-and-red geometry).  

## Typography (optional)
- Bold sans-serif type in Cyrillic or blocky Latin; all caps; angular placement (slanted, rotated, vertical).  
- Can be placed in bars or banners across diagonals.  

## Do
- Emphasize geometry, rhythm, and structure.  
- Use flat bold color, no gradients.  
- High-contrast, print-like appearance.  

## Avoid
- Photographic realism or fine detail.  
- Blurry edges, soft shading, pastel palettes.
