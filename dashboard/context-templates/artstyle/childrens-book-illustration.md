# Art Style: Children's Book Illustration

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Cheerful and varied—bright primaries and pastels; not strictly realistic.  
- **Finish:** Flat fills or softly textured brush strokes; crisp outlines or sketch-like pencil/ink lines.  
- **Figure treatment:** Simplified, round, and expressive; slightly exaggerated proportions for charm.  
- **Composition:** Open, easy-to-read scenes with playful framing; leave some breathing space.  
- **Lighting:** Simple, clear—avoid complex shading; occasional soft highlight for warmth.  

## Background Treatment
- Whimsical, storybook-inspired backdrops (rolling hills, clouds, stars, forests, small houses).  
- Decorative elements can float in space or suggest context without realism.  

## Texture
- Paper-like grain or watercolor wash is welcome; avoid heavy gradients.  
- Hand-drawn imperfection is part of the charm—slightly uneven lines, playful doodle quality.  

## Optional Iconography
- Stars, moons, flowers, balloons, animals, toys, or magical sparks.  
- Lettering or text bubbles can be included if it adds narrative whimsy.  

## Do
- Emphasize charm, humor, and playfulness.  
- Keep forms bold and readable at small sizes.  
- Allow randomness and surprise—like turning everyday objects into friendly characters.  

## Avoid
- Hyperrealism or photographic detail.  
- Excessive gradients or over-polished rendering.  
- Dark, gritty, or overly dramatic tones.
