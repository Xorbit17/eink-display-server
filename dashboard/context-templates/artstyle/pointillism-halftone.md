# Style: Pointillism Halftone

This art style uses dots, stippling, or halftone patterns to build form, shading, and texture. It merges the painterly feel of pointillism with the graphic sharpness of halftone printing.

Choose one of these colors (native to e-ink): black, yellow, red, blue, green
Or mix different colors with varying size dot dithering

## Core Look
- **Technique:** Construct forms from clusters of dots. Use small, tight dots for shadows and larger, spaced dots for highlights.
- **Palette:** Limited tonal values—3 to 5 shades. Stick to monochrome or a restricted palette (e.g., black + one or two accent colors).
- **Finish:** Crisp edges, no gradients—shading emerges only from density of dots.
- **Figure treatment:** Defined by contour edges and tonal dot clusters; avoid smooth airbrushed effects.

## Composition
- Allow visible variation in dot size/density for texture.
- Keep subject clearly legible, with stronger dot density around edges for clarity.
- Background can be treated with lighter halftone fields or sparse dot patterns to prevent visual clutter.

## Lighting
- High contrast lighting works best—shadows and highlights should translate into areas of dense vs. sparse dot clusters.

## Do
- Emphasize structure through controlled dot size and spacing.
- Keep tonal separation bold and readable.
- Use halftone-style screen patterns for mid-tones if desired.

## Avoid
- Smooth gradients or painterly blending.
- Excessively fine dots (too close to noise on e-ink).
- Blurry edges or soft focus effects.
