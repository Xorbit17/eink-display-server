# Art Style: Blueprint Technical

- **Core Look**
  - Monochromatic blueprint aesthetic: deep blue background with white or pale cyan linework.
  - Thin, precise lines resembling technical drafting—use consistent stroke weights.
  - Emphasize geometry, measurements, and structure rather than shading or realism.
  - Figures and objects simplified into wireframe-like outlines with minimal fill.

- **Background & Layout**
  - Background should resemble blueprint paper—solid blue with subtle grid or crosshatch texture.
  - Optional annotation elements: measurement arrows, labels, schematic callouts.
  - Prefer clean, technical symmetry; centered or orthographic projection views.

- **Shading & Depth**
  - Avoid gradients or painterly shading—rely instead on crosshatch, stipple, or layered contour lines if depth is needed.
  - Flat and uniform tones dominate.

- **Optional Elements**
  - Technical icons (compass, gears, joints, schematic arrows).
  - Dashed construction lines or circular guides.
  - White borders or title blocks at edges (like an engineering sheet).

- **Do**
  - Keep lines sharp and crisp—no softness or blur.
  - Use uniform scale and spacing.
  - Apply architectural/engineering drawing conventions where appropriate.

- **Avoid**
  - Photographic realism, painterly textures, gradients, or vibrant colors.
  - Overly detailed micro-patterns smaller than 5px.
