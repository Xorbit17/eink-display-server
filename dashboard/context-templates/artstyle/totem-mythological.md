# Style: Totem-Mythological

## Core Look
- **Form & Composition:** Subjects are stacked vertically, like a carved totem pole. Each head/creature is placed on top of the other, forming a unified column. Ideal for multi-subject portraits.  
- **Palette:** Natural yet symbolic colors—earth tones (brown, ochre, stone-gray) mixed with strong accent hues (turquoise, red, black, white).  
- **Line & Finish:** Bold, carved-like outlines; simplified, geometric shapes; flat fills with minimal gradients; heavy contrast for a sculptural look.  
- **Texture:** Woodgrain or stone-etch effects to suggest carved surfaces. Slight ornamental patterning around edges.  

## Figure Treatment
- **Faces/Heads:** Abstracted, mythic features—exaggerated eyes, angular noses, stylized mouths. Human or animal heads become archetypal rather than realistic.  
- **Animals/Creatures:** Hybrid mythological beasts (e.g., eagle with horns, wolf with flame patterns). Should feel iconic, spiritual, symbolic rather than naturalistic.  
- **Stacking:** Each subject should clearly transition into the next—torsos compressed into simplified blocky bases, flowing upward into the next head/figure.  

## Background Options
- Plain neutral field (stone, bark, or sky blue) to highlight the vertical totem column.  
- Optional symbolic motifs: sun disks, moon phases, feathers, geometric tribal patterns in the background.  

## Do
- Emphasize vertical symmetry and repetition.  
- Keep designs bold, graphic, and emblematic.  
- Ensure strong outlines and clear separations between stacked heads/figures.  

## Avoid
- Realistic shading or photographic detail.  
- Overly modern gradients or glossy finishes.  
- Random floating heads—stacking must feel intentional and structured like a pole.
