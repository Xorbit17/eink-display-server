# Art Style: Woodcut Engraving

## Core Look
- **Linework:** Dense, parallel hatching and crosshatching lines carved into the surface; bold contours and textured shading.
- **Shading:** Achieved entirely through line density and direction—no smooth gradients.
- **Contrast:** Strong black-and-white contrast with areas of solid black balanced by intricate line-filled highlights.
- **Edges:** Crisp, carved edges—avoid softness or blurriness.

## Figure & Composition
- Figures and objects should appear stylized, slightly stiff, as if carved into wood.
- Emphasize bold outlines and heavy use of shadow shapes.
- Textures (skin, fabric, background) rendered through repetitive carved lines.
- Backgrounds may use patterned fills (diagonal hatching, wave motifs, cross lines).

## Lighting
- Harsh, high-contrast lighting—dark shadows etched with tight linework.
- Avoid subtle tone transitions; rely on carving-like marks.

## Optional Motifs
- Ornamental frames, borders, or decorative flourishes.
- Medieval or Renaissance-inspired iconography, symbols, or heraldic elements.

## Do
- Keep detail bold and graphic; think carved, not painted.
- Let linework carry most of the shading and depth.
- Preserve a slightly rough, handcrafted look.

## Avoid
- Smooth airbrushed gradients or painterly blending.
- Overly fine micro-details under ~5 pixels.
- Blurry edges or antialiased lines.
