# Style: Moebius French Sci-Fi

## Core Look
- **Linework:** Extremely fine, flowing ink lines; elegant contour work; intricate crosshatching used sparingly.
- **Coloring:** Flat yet luminous pastel tones (turquoise, ochre, lavender, pale pink, sandy beige); otherworldly palettes that feel dreamlike.
- **Figures:** Elongated, graceful anatomy; serene expressions; simple, calm postures.
- **Composition:** Expansive, airy layouts; wide horizons; uncluttered negative space enhancing sense of scale.
- **Lighting:** Clear and even—sunlit desert clarity or diffuse alien glow.

## Background & Setting
- **Architecture:** Futuristic yet organic—smooth domes, spires, crystalline towers, impossible geometries.
- **Landscapes:** Vast alien deserts, surreal rock formations, endless skies, floating islands.
- **Textures:** Clean line emphasis, minimal shading; sense of infinite space.
- **Perspective:** Emphasize depth with sweeping horizons and vanishing points.

## Optional Iconography
- Surreal creatures—delicate, insect-like, or birdlike beings.
- Characters in flowing robes, ornate helmets, light sci-fi gear.
- Ancient ruins mixed with futuristic machines.

## Do
