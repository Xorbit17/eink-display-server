# Style: Etching Copperplate

Not the copper is shown but a black and white drawing of a sketch to be etched on a copper plate. White background, black strokes.

## Core Look
- **Linework:** Fine, delicate etched lines; precise contour strokes; visible hatching and crosshatching for tone.  
- **Shading:** Built through dense line work—parallel strokes, cross-lines, stippling; avoid smooth gradients.  
- **Tone:** High contrast black and white; sometimes soft sepia tint; emphasis on chiaroscuro through line density.  
- **Edges:** Crisp, incised quality; slight irregularities reflecting hand-etched feel.  

## Figures & Subjects
- Anatomical precision and detail, classical rendering of faces and bodies.  
- Emphasis on expressive textures in hair, fabric folds, and skin.  
- Suited for portraits, architectural scenes, mythological or allegorical subjects.  

## Composition
- Balanced and formal layouts; symmetrical or carefully constructed arrangements.  
- Strong sense of depth created by varied line densities.  
- Borders or framing lines optional—like printed plates.  

## Background Treatment
- Minimal flat areas; instead filled with hatching or engraved patterns.  
- Subtle architectural details, ornamental flourishes, or simple textural fields.  

## Do
- Keep lines sharp and consistent in width.  
- Use layered hatching for shadow and dimension.  
- Allow white space to balance dense inked areas.  

## Avoid
- Blurry edges or painterly washes.  
- Flat fills of gradient shading.  
- Excessive softness or digital smoothness.
