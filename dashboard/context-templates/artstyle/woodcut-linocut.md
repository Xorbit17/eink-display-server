# Style: Woodcut / Linocut

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Strong black-and-white contrast; limited two- or three-tone palette if color is desired (deep red, muted blue, earthy ochre).
- **Linework:** Bold, carved lines with visible cuts and gouges; sharp, angular contours; irregular hand-cut feel.
- **Texture:** Use hatching, crosshatching, and parallel gouge marks to create shading and depth.
- **Finish:** Slightly rough, imperfect edges—show the handmade quality.

## Figure Treatment
- Stylized, simplified anatomy and features—emphasis on outline and negative space.
- Expressive postures, often dramatic or symbolic.
- Avoid fine details; focus on graphic clarity.

## Composition
- Strong central figure or motif.
- Flat background planes with carved texture patterns (waves, rays, woodgrain, abstract shapes).
- Symmetry or radial layouts work well.

## Do
- Emphasize bold contrasts and cut marks.
- Use heavy black regions against sharp white incisions.
- Create a tactile, relief-printed look.

## Avoid
- Smooth gradients or soft digital blending.
- Photographic detail or painterly rendering.
- Excessive realism; keep it graphic and carved.
