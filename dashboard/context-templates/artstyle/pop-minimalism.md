# Style: Pop Minimalism

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Bold, flat colors inspired by pop art (primary tones, vivid pinks, bright greens, yellows, and blues).  
- **Finish:** Crisp, simplified forms; high contrast; clean vector-like edges.  
- **Figure treatment:** Reduce to essential shapes and outlines; avoid fine details—favor bold silhouettes and stylized features.  
- **Composition:** Strong use of negative space; centered or balanced layouts with geometric clarity.  

## Background
- Flat, single-color fields or minimal geometric patterns (stripes, dots, blocks).  
- Optional color blocking to create contrast with subject.  

## Shading & Depth
- Little to no shading—flat fills dominate.  
- If needed, use single-tone drop shadows or hard-edged highlights for dimension.  

## Iconography (optional)
- Pop-art motifs like dots, halftone patterns, or speech-bubble style graphic elements.  
- Abstract geometric shapes (circles, triangles, rectangles) for balance and rhythm.  

## Do
- Keep forms bold, simple, and graphic.  
- Emphasize color harmony and striking contrasts.  
- Ensure edges are sharp and crisp.  

## Avoid
- Photorealistic rendering, subtle gradients, or painterly textures.  
- Overcrowding with too many details—minimalism is key.
