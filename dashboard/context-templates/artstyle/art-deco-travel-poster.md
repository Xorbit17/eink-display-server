# Style: Art Deco Travel Poster

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Rich, bold, and harmonious—deep blues, emerald greens, ochres, gold, muted coral; often limited to a few strong tones.
- **Finish:** Smooth, flat color areas; posterized shading with crisp transitions; no gradients.
- **Figure treatment:** Simplified, elegant, elongated forms; geometric stylization; minimal facial detail.
- **Composition:** Strong symmetry, balance, and verticality; dramatic angles or upward-looking perspectives to suggest grandeur.
- **Lighting:** Sharp, clean divisions of light and shadow; sunburst or spotlight effects.

## Background Options
- Stylized landscapes, cityscapes, or iconic landmarks rendered with geometric precision.
- Radiating lines, concentric circles, or deco pattern motifs framing the subject.
- Simplified skies, sunbursts, or stylized clouds.

## Typography (optional)
- Short slogan or destination name in bold, sans-serif or deco-style lettering.
- Placement at top or bottom in a color bar, often paired with decorative framing.

## Do
- Use crisp, geometric ornamentation (chevrons, zigzags, arches).
- Keep detail minimal but impactful—focus on form and symmetry.
- Add framing borders or bands that mimic period poster layouts.

## Avoid
- Photographic realism, fine detail, or painterly brushstrokes.
- Blurry edges, gradients, or overly soft shading.
