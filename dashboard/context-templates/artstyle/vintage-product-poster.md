# Style: Vintage Product Poster

This art style is inspired by mid-20th century commercial product advertising posters.

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Muted retro colors—cream, faded reds, soft blues, mustard yellows, olive greens.  
- **Finish:** Flat color fields with slight print texture or halftone; crisp edges.  
- **Illustration style:** Hand-painted or lithographic look; simplified, idealized forms; cheerful expressions.  
- **Composition:** Product placed prominently, often centered or angled for display; accompanying figures (smiling family, workers, homemakers) posed confidently.  
- **Lighting:** Even, frontal lighting—slight highlights to make products gleam.  

## Background & Setting
- **Background:** Clean with solid color or simple patterns (radiating rays, stripes, geometric framing).  
- **Setting cues:** Suggestive kitchen, diner, shop, or household environment without clutter.  

## Typography (optional)
- Bold retro typefaces—sans-serif or script styles reminiscent of 1940s–1960s ads.  
- Slogans like *“New!”*, *“Fresh taste”*, *“Best choice”*.  
- Text placement integrated with product (curved banners, ribbons, corner boxes).  

## Do
- Highlight the product as the “star” of the composition.  
- Use nostalgic color printing effects (slight mis-registration, halftone dots).  
- Keep design bold, clear, and optimistic.  

## Avoid
- Photographic realism.  
- Modern gradients, glossy 3D rendering, or digital neon effects.  
- Overly detailed cluttered scenes.
