# Style: Papercut Layer Art

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Bold, solid colors or subtle tonal variations; minimal gradients—each layer should look like distinct paper stock.  
- **Finish:** Crisp, cut-out edges with visible layering; slight drop-shadow effect to suggest depth between layers.  
- **Texture:** Subtle paper grain is welcome; avoid glossy or overly smooth digital look.  

## Figure Treatment
- Simplify forms into flat silhouettes with clear contours.  
- Use overlapping shapes to build complexity rather than fine detail.  
- Avoid excessive realism—embrace the handcrafted, collage-like quality.  

## Composition
- Multiple staggered layers create depth, like stacked sheets of paper.  
- Foreground, midground, and background should be clearly separated by color and shadow.  
- Elements can “peek through” cut-out holes or windows in layers.  

## Lighting & Shadow
- Gentle inner shadows between paper layers to enhance dimensionality.  
- No soft glows or blurry edges—edges must stay sharp and well-defined.  

## Background Options
- A solid or lightly textured backdrop layer (toned paper, parchment, or muted color field).  
- Optional negative-space cutouts forming patterns (e.g., foliage, waves, clouds).  

## Do
- Emphasize depth through overlapping cut-out forms.  
- Use color contrast to separate layers clearly.  
- Keep edges sharp and unblurred.  

## Avoid
- Photographic shading, smooth gradients, or painterly blending.  
- Overly intricate micro-details.  
- Flat single-layer compositions without visible stacking.
