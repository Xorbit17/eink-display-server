# Style: Minimal Vector Portrait

## Core Look
- **Shapes:** Simplify facial features and clothing into clean, geometric vector forms.  
- **Palette:** Flat, bold blocks of color; minimal shading; avoid gradients.  
- **Linework:** Crisp, uniform contour lines or shape edges; no texture or sketch marks.  
- **Detail Level:** Omit small details like skin texture, pores, or fine wrinkles; focus on large, recognizable forms.  

## Figure Treatment
- **Faces:** Reduce eyes, nose, and mouth to iconic shapes while keeping them recognizable.  
- **Hair:** Stylize into flat blocks or layered vector forms with sharp, clean divisions of color.  
- **Clothing:** Represented by large, flat shapes with only essential folds indicated.  

## Composition
- Centered portrait layout, often bust or shoulders-up.  
- Symmetrical balance or slightly off-center for dynamism.  
- Backgrounds: Solid or simple flat color; optional bold geometric block for framing.  

## Do
- Emphasize clean contrast between shapes.  
- Use bold, distinct color fields.  
- Maintain accurate silhouette and proportions.  

## Avoid
- Gradients, painterly shading, or photorealistic detail.  
- Blurry edges or overcomplicated textures.  
- Excessive micro-detail that breaks the minimal aesthetic.
