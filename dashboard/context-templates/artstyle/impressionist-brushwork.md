# Style: Impressionist Brushwork

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Bright, natural colors inspired by outdoor light; emphasize complementary contrasts (blue/orange, red/green, purple/yellow).
- **Brushwork:** Loose, visible strokes; layered dabs or short strokes rather than smooth blends.
- **Finish:** Painterly texture with varied stroke direction; edges remain soft and suggestive, not sharply defined.
- **Composition:** Focus on atmosphere and mood over fine detail; capture fleeting expressions, light, and motion.
- **Lighting:** Strong sense of natural light, with broken color to suggest shimmering highlights and shifting tones.
- **Background treatment:** Suggestive forms and shapesâ€”avoid hard detail; let brushwork imply setting.

## Do
- Keep figures recognizable but simplified, with strokes that imply form rather than rigid outlines.
- Emphasize vibrancy and movement through color and texture.
- Allow visible paint texture to create depth and life.

## Avoid
- Photographic realism or polished, smooth shading.
- Overly sharp outlines, harsh digital gradients, or excessive detail.
