# Art Style: Pixar-Style

A stylized 3D animated look inspired by Pixar movies (used here purely as an art style reference).

## Core Look
- **Palette:** Warm, saturated colors with polished tonal balance; soft but distinct highlights.
- **Finish:** Smooth surfaces with subtle texturing; rounded, appealing forms; minimal visible brush strokes.
- **Figure treatment:** Expressive facial features with slightly exaggerated proportions; clean silhouettes.
- **Composition:** Cinematic framing; clear focus on character(s); simple but atmospheric staging.
- **Lighting:** Warm, directional lighting with gentle falloff; subtle bounce light; bright eyeshine.
- **Background options:** Simplified 3D-like environments (domestic interiors, natural scenery, playful props).

## Do
- Keep edges crisp and cleanâ€”avoid painterly fuzz.
- Use stylized realism, not photo-realism.
- Emphasize charm and polished finish.

## Avoid
- Hyper-detailed textures.
- Heavy gradients or flat 2D look.
- References to specific Pixar characters or films.
