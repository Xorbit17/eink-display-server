# Style: Naturalist Sketch

- **Linework & Color**
  - Detailed but restrained ink linework, carefully outlining plant or animal forms with scientific clarity.
  - Apply selective hand-tinted washes in muted natural colors (greens, browns, yellows, ochres).
  - Keep tones flat or gently shaded—avoid heavy gradients.

- **Composition**
  - Subject (plant, insect, or animal) is centered or isolated, presented for study rather than decoration.
  - Minimal background—preferably plain parchment, off-white, or lightly textured paper tone.
  - Include scientific annotations or handwritten labels if appropriate.

- **Shading & Depth**
  - Use hatching or stippling sparingly to suggest form and depth.
  - Prioritize accuracy and recognizability of natural details (leaf shapes, wing patterns, bark textures).

- **Overall Aesthetic**
  - Resembles early botanical or zoological illustration plates.
  - Clean, precise, and slightly aged in look.
  - Emphasis on observation, taxonomy, and educational clarity over artistic flourish.

# Notes
- Avoid cartoonish exaggeration or modern comic stylization.
- No blurriness or painterly smudging—lines must remain crisp.
- Keep style scientific and natural, not decorative.
