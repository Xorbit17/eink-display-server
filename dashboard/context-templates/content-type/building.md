# Building

A photograph of a building is related to a cherished memory of a (work) trip in which people have done some cool things in and around that building. Some buildings are also inherently beautiful (e.g. cathedral) or impressive (e.g. tall office building).

Make sure to empathize the grandeur of the building for large buildings and use perspective to enhance size and impressiveness.

Make sure to empathize the coziness and atmosphere of smaller buildings in nature or agricultural/wooded settings.

For buildings set in beautiful nature make sure the background is present in the image. For building set in cities it's the opposite; the chaotic city around the building can distract from its architecture and artistically the image can benefit from the setting being left out.
