# Nature

Nature photos include plants and trees in isolation. Or perhaps a forest or a coral. There are separate categories for landscapes and animals.

Try to isolate an interesting subject when there is a clear subject in the photo (e.g. plant).

When the photo has a wider view, showing multiple things with more, complex, objects try to frame it as a general image that conveys the emotion as to _why_ the nature shot is beautiful.
