# Object subject

There are one or more beautiful, rare, remarkable or emotionally relevant objects in the picture.
It the background is nice center the object and zoom out a little more.
If the background is unremarkable focus solely on the object.

Objects have relevance for people because they remember receiving the object, admiring the object or doing something with the object. Make sure the object is center of frame and rotate it if the object does not require a particular orientation (e.g. cars cannot be rotated because their wheels are on the ground, but a hammer is a tool which can be shown in any orientation).
