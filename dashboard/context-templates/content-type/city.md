# City

Photos of cities are relevant as cherished memories of travel and city trips. Cities are complex and the photos contain a lot of information. When generating art focus on the 'feeling' of the city; rather than all the details. In some cases and for some art styles the level of detail can be deliberately high. For other art styles (thicker lines, broader strokes or pixels, ...) the level of detail may be reduced.

So. For art styles that support it include the chaos and the details. In other cases leave out details but preserve the atmosphere and the 'feeling' of the city.
